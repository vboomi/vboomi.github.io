        "abstract": "Modern biology increasingly relies on fluorescence microscopy, which is driving demand for smaller, lighter, and cheaper microscopes. However, traditional microscope architectures suffer from a fundamental trade-off: As lenses become smaller, they must either collect less light or image a smaller field of view. To break this fundamental trade-off between device size and performance, we present a new concept for three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence imaging that replaces lenses with an optimized amplitude mask placed a few hundred micrometers above the sensor and an efficient algorithm that can convert a single frame of captured sensor data into high-resolution 3D images. The result is FlatScope: perhaps the world's tiniest and lightest microscope. FlatScope is a lensless microscope that is scarcely larger than an image sensor (roughly 0.2 g in weight and less than 1 mm thick) and yet able to produce micrometer-resolution, high\u2013frame rate, 3D fluorescence movies covering a total volume of several cubic millimeters. The ability of FlatScope to reconstruct full 3D images from a single frame of captured sensor data allows us to image 3D volumes roughly 40,000 times faster than a laser scanning confocal microscope while providing comparable resolution. We envision that this new flat fluorescence microscopy paradigm will lead to implantable endoscopes that minimize tissue damage, arrays of imagers that cover large areas, and bendable, flexible microscopes that conform to complex topographies.",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate a compact and easy-to-build computational camera for single-shot 3D imaging. Our lensless system consists solely of a diffuser placed in front of a standard image sensor. Every point within the volumetric field-of-view projects a unique pseudorandom pattern of caustics on the sensor. By using a physical approximation and simple calibration scheme, we solve the large-scale inverse problem in a computationally efficient way. The caustic patterns enable compressed sensing, which exploits sparsity in the sample to solve for more 3D voxels than pixels on the 2D sensor. Our 3D voxel grid is chosen to match the experimentally measured two-point optical resolution across the field-of-view, resulting in 100 million voxels being reconstructed from a single 1.3 megapixel image. However, the effective resolution varies significantly with scene content. Because this effect is common to a wide range of computational cameras, we provide new theory for analyzing resolution in such systems.",

        "abstract": "Because image sensor chips have a finite bandwidth with which to read out pixels, recording video typically requires a trade-off between frame rate and pixel count. Compressed sensing techniques can circumvent this trade-off by assuming that the image is compressible. Here, we propose using multiplexing optics to spatially compress the scene, enabling information about the whole scene to be sampled from a row of sensor pixels, which can be read off quickly via a rolling shutter CMOS sensor. Conveniently, such multiplexing can be achieved with a simple lensless, diffuser-based imaging system. Using sparse recovery methods, we are able to recover 140 video frames at over 4,500 frames per second, all from a single captured image with a rolling shutter sensor. Our proof-of-concept system uses easily-fabricated diffusers paired with an off-the-shelf sensor. The resulting prototype enables compressive encoding of high frame rate video into a single rolling shutter exposure, and exceeds the sampling-limited performance of an equivalent global shutter system for sufficiently sparse objects.",

Unlike a traditional, lens-based camera, where an image of the scene is directly recorded on the sensor pixels, each pixel in FlatCam records a linear combination of light from multiple scene elements. A computational algorithm is then used to demultiplex the recorded measurements and reconstruct an image of the scene. FlatCam is an instance of a coded aperture imaging system; however, unlike the vast majority of related work, we place the coded mask extremely close to the image sensor that enables thin and flat form-factor imaging devices. We employ a separable mask to ensure that both calibration and image reconstruction are scalable in terms of memory requirements and computational complexity. We demonstrate the potential of the FlatCam design using two prototypes: one at visible wavelengths and one at infrared wavelengths.",

By using partially coherent illumination from a large aperture (approximately 50 microm), we acquire lower resolution lensfree in-line holograms of the objects with unit fringe magnification. For each lensfree hologram, the pixel size at the sensor chip limits the spatial resolution of the reconstructed image. To circumvent this limitation, we implement a sub-pixel shifting based super-resolution algorithm to effectively recover much higher resolution digital holograms of the objects, permitting sub-micron spatial resolution to be achieved across the entire sensor chip active area, which is also equivalent to the imaging field-of-view (24 mm2) due to unit magnification. We demonstrate the success of this pixel super-resolution approach by imaging patterned transparent substrates, blood smear samples, as well as Caenoharbditis Elegans.",

From a single 2D encoded measurement, we show the reconstruction of high-resolution 2D images, computational refocusing, and 3D imaging. This ability is made possible by our proposed high-performance contour-based PSF. The heuristic contour-based PSF is designed using concepts in signal processing to achieve maximal information transfer to a bit-depth limited sensor.

        "abstract": "Microlens array-based light-field imaging has been one of the most commonly used and effective technologies to record high-dimensional optical signals for developing various potential high-performance applications in many fields. However, the use of a microlens array generally suffers from an intrinsic trade-off between the spatial and angular resolutions. In this paper, we concentrate on exploiting a diffuser to explore a novel modality for light-field imaging. We demonstrate that the diffuser can efficiently angularly couple incident light rays into a detected image without needing any lens. To characterize and analyse this phenomenon, we establish a diffuser-encoding light-field transmission model, in which four-dimensional light fields are mapped into two-dimensional images via a transmission matrix describing the light propagation through the diffuser. Correspondingly, a calibration strategy is designed to flexibly determine the transmission matrix, so that light rays can be computationally decoupled from a detected image with adjustable spatio-angular resolutions, which are unshackled from the resolution limitation of the sensor. The proof-of-concept approach indicates the possibility of using scattering media for lensless four-dimensional light-field recording and processing, not just for two- or three-dimensional imaging.",

        "abstract": "In certain imaging applications, conventional lens technology is constrained by the lack of materials which can effectively focus the radiation within a reasonable weight and volume. One solution is to use coded apertures-opaque plates perforated with multiple pinhole-like openings. If the openings are arranged in an appropriate pattern, then the images can be decoded and a clear image computed. Recently, computational imaging and the search for a means of producing programmable software-defined optics have revived interest in coded apertures. The former state-of-the-art masks, modified uniformly redundant arrays (MURAs), are effective for compact objects against uniform backgrounds, but have substantial drawbacks for extended scenes: (1) MURAs present an inherently ill-posed inversion problem that is unmanageable for large images, and (2) they are susceptible to diffraction: a diffracted MURA is no longer a MURA. We present a new class of coded apertures, separable Doubly-Toeplitz masks, which are efficiently decodable even for very large images-orders of magnitude faster than MURAs, and which remain decodable when diffracted. We implemented the masks using programmable spatial-light-modulators. Imaging experiments confirmed the effectiveness of separable Doubly-Toeplitz masks-images collected in natural light of extended outdoor scenes are rendered clearly.",

While most microscopic systems sacrifice the field of view for magnification, lensless systems have taken advantage of small imaging pixel size, projection, digital magnification, and post-processing to compensate for diffracted images. A new lens-based system is designed to have the exact same wide field of view as that of a basic lensless setup. A new compound lens system design is utilized to achieve an explicit aim to have the same fields of view as the lensless setup. Then the characteristics of these two optical imaging setups (lensless and lens-based setups) are compared at this level of complexity to see what the minimal systems principles are needed to achieve the biological imaging goals for simplified and less expensive future designs. For both imaging systems, images of biological entities are recorded with the help of the same CMOS imaging device and computer software.

To resolve this, we propose imaging with a set of mask patterns displayed on a programmable mask, and introduce a computational focusing operator that helps to resolve the depth of scene points. As a result, the proposed imager can resolve dense scenes with large depth variations, allowing for more practical applications of lensless cameras. We also present a fast reconstruction algorithm for scene at multiple depths that reduces reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude. Finally, we build a prototype to show the proposed method improves both image quality and depth resolution of lensless cameras.",

The aperture assembly consists of a two dimensional array of aperture elements. The transmittance of each aperture element is independently controllable. The sensor is a single detection element. A compressive sensing matrix is implemented by adjusting the transmittance of the individual aperture elements according to the values of the sensing matrix. The proposed architecture is simple and reliable because no lens is used. The architecture can be used for capturing images of visible and other spectra such as infrared, or millimeter waves, in surveillance applications for detecting anomalies or extracting features such as speed of moving objects. Multiple sensors may be used with a single aperture assembly to capture multiview images simultaneously.

        "abstract": "We report a novel lensless on-chip microscopy platform based on near-field blind ptychographic modulation. In this platform, we place a thin diffuser in between the object and the image sensor for light wave modulation. By blindly scanning the unknown diffuser to different x-y positions, we acquire a sequence of modulated intensity images for quantitative object recovery. Different from previous ptychographic implementations, we employ a unit magnification configuration with a Fresnel number of \u223c50 000, which is orders of magnitude higher than those of previous ptychographic setups. The unit magnification configuration allows us to have the entire sensor area, 6.4 mm by 4.6 mm, as the imaging field of view. The ultra-high Fresnel number enables us to directly recover the positional shift of the diffuser in the phase retrieval process, addressing the positioning accuracy issue plaguing regular ptychographic experiments. In our implementation, we use a low-cost, DIY scanning stage to perform blind diffuser modulation. Precise mechanical scanning that is critical in conventional ptychography experiments is no longer needed in our setup. We further employ an up-sampling phase retrieval scheme to bypass the resolution limit set by the imager pixel size and demonstrate a half-pitch resolution of 0.78 $\\mu$m. We validate the imaging performance via in vitro cell cultures, transparent and stained tissue sections, and a thick biological sample. We show that the recovered quantitative phase map can be used to perform effective cell segmentation of a dense yeast culture. We also demonstrate 3D digital refocusing of the thick biological sample based on the recovered wavefront. The reported platform provides a cost-effective and turnkey solution for large field-of-view, high-resolution, and quantitative on-chip microscopy. It is adaptable for a wide range of point-of-care-, global-health-, and telemedicine-related applications.",

Mask-based lensless imaging systems make such inexpensive and compact models realizable. However, reduction in the size and cost of these imagers comes at the expense of their image quality due to the high degree of multiplexing inherent in their design. In this paper, we present a method to obtain image reconstructions from mask-based lensless measurements that are more photorealistic than those currently available in the literature. We particularly focus on FlatCam, a lensless imager consisting of a coded mask placed over a bare CMOS sensor. Existing techniques for reconstructing FlatCam measurements suffer from several drawbacks including lower resolution and dynamic range than lens-based cameras. Our approach overcomes these drawbacks using a fully trainable non-iterative deep learning based model. Our approach is based on two stages: An inversion stage that maps the measurement into the space of intermediate reconstruction and a perceptual enhancement stage that improves this intermediate reconstruction based on perceptual and signal distortion metrics. Our proposed method is fast and produces photo-realistic reconstruction as demonstrated on many real and challenging scenes.",

Without a focusing lens, the lensless cameras rely on computational algorithms to recover the scenes from multiplexed measurements. However, the current iterative-optimization-based reconstruction algorithms produce noisier and perceptually poorer images. In this work, we propose a non-iterative deep learning-based reconstruction approach that results in orders of magnitude improvement in image quality for lensless reconstructions. Our approach, called FlatNet, lays down a framework for reconstructing high-quality photorealistic images from mask-based lensless cameras, where the camera's forward model formulation is known. FlatNet consists of two stages: (1) an inversion stage that maps the measurement into a space of intermediate reconstruction by learning parameters within the forward model formulation, and (2) a perceptual enhancement stage that improves the perceptual quality of this intermediate reconstruction. These stages are trained together in an end-to-end manner. We show high-quality reconstructions by performing extensive experiments on real and challenging scenes using two different types of lensless prototypes: one which uses a separable forward model and another, which uses a more general non-separable cropped-convolution model. Our end-to-end approach is fast, produces photorealistic reconstructions, and is easy to adopt for other mask-based lensless cameras.",

Lensless imaging based on multi-wavelength phase retrieval becomes a promising technology widely used as it has simple acquisition, miniaturized size and low-cost setup. However, measuring the sample-to-sensor distance with high accuracy, which is the key for high-resolution reconstruction, is still a challenge. In this work, we propose a multiwavelength criterion to realize autofocusing modulation, i.e., achieving much higher accuracy in determining the sample-to-sensor distance, compared to the conventional methods. Three beams in different spectrums are adopted to illuminate the sample, and the resulting holograms are recorded by a CCD camera. The patterns calculated by performing back propagation of the recorded holograms, with exhaustively searched sample-to-sensor distance value, are adopted to access the criterion. Image sharpness can be accessed and the optimal sample-to-sensor distance can be finely determined by targeting the valley of the curve given by the criterion. Through our novel multi-wavelength based autofocusing strategy and executing further phase retrieval process, high-resolution images can be finally retrieved. The applicability and robustness of our method is validated both in simulations and experiments. Our technique provides a useful tool for multi-wavelength lensless imaging under limited experimental conditions.",

        "abstract": "Light scattering is typically undesired in optical systems as it often introduces defects or otherwise negatively impacts device performance. However, rather than being a hindrance, scattering can also be exploited to achieve lensless imaging using a scattering mask instead of lenses to enable devices with low-cost, compact construction, and yet a large field of view. Lensless imaging can benefit greatly from the ability to dynamically tune the scattering pattern produced by the mask; however, this often results in increased complexity and cost. Herein, we propose and demonstrate particle-based reconfigurable scattering masks to dynamically tune light scattering for lensless imaging, enabling multishot image reconstruction. Disordered particle populations are tuned by rational application of electric fields without requiring bulky or expensive components. Several assembly motifs are explored and studied for optimal performance; in particular, gold nanowires chained between planar electrodes yield the best reconstruction quality and are the main focus in this study. The distinct gold nanowire based scattering masks achieve a complex wavelet structural similarity as low as 0.36. By leveraging the submicrometer thickness of particles and the resultant large optical memory effect, an angular field of view of \u00b145\u00b0 is demonstrated. The reconfigurable nature of the particle arrays enables multishot reconstruction which results in enhanced image quality and improved signal-to-noise ratios by up to 10-fold. These results suggest that reconfigurable particle masks could be a broadly applicable means of achieving dynamically tunable light scattering with potential applications in lensless microscopy or high-resolution imaging.",

In this paper, we propose a novel, compact, and inexpensive computational camera for snapshot hyperspectral imaging. Our system consists of a repeated spectral filter array placed directly on the image sensor and a diffuser placed close to the sensor. Each point in the world maps to a unique pseudorandom pattern on the spectral filter array, which encodes multiplexed spatio-spectral information. A sparsity-constrained inverse problem solver then recovers the hyperspectral volume with good spatio-spectral resolution. By using a spectral filter array, our hyperspectral imaging framework is flexible and can be designed with contiguous or non-contiguous spectral filters that can be chosen for a given application.

In the meantime, microscopy in resource-limited settings has requirements significantly different from those encountered in advanced laboratories, and such imaging devices should be cost-effective, compact, light-weight and appropriately accurate and simple to be usable by minimally trained personnel. Furthermore, these portable microscopes should ideally be digitally integrated as part of a telemedicine network that connects various mobile health-care providers to a central laboratory or hospital. Toward this end, here we demonstrate a lensless on-chip microscope weighing \u223c46 grams with dimensions smaller than 4.2 cm \u00d7 4.2 cm \u00d7 5.8 cm that achieves sub-cellular resolution over a large field of view of \u223c24 mm2. This compact and light-weight microscope is based on digital in-line holography and does not need any lenses, bulky optical/mechanical components or coherent sources such as lasers. Instead, it utilizes a simple light-emitting-diode (LED) and a compact opto-electronic sensor-array to record lensless holograms of the objects, which then permits rapid digital reconstruction of regular transmission or differential interference contrast (DIC) images of the objects. Because this lensless incoherent holographic microscope has orders-of-magnitude improved light collection efficiency and is very robust to mechanical misalignments it may offer a cost-effective tool especially for telemedicine applications involving various global health problems in resource limited settings. {\\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010.",

        "abstract": "High-resolution optical microscopy has traditionally relied on high-magnification and high-numerical aperture objective lenses. In contrast, lensless microscopy can provide high-resolution images without the use of any focusing lenses, offering the advantages of a large field of view, high resolution, cost-effectiveness, portability, and depth-resolved three-dimensional (3D) imaging. Here we review various approaches to lensless imaging, as well as its applications in biosensing, diagnostics, and cytometry. These approaches include shadow imaging, fluorescence, holography, superresolution 3D imaging, iterative phase recovery, and color imaging. These approaches share a reliance on computational techniques, which are typically necessary to reconstruct meaningful images from the raw data captured by digital image sensors. When these approaches are combined with physical innovations in sample preparation and fabrication, lensless imaging can be used to image and sense cells, viruses, nanoparticles, and biomolecules. We conclude by discussing several ways in which lensless imaging and sensing might develop in the near future.",

This work proposes a new data preprocessing approach, named local binary patterns map generation, dedicated for optically encoded pattern through the mask. This preprocessing approach greatly improves encoded pattern&#x2019;s robustness to local disturbances in the scene, making the LLI camera&#x2019;s practical application possible.

        "abstract": "Lensless imaging is a new, emerging modality where image sensors utilize optical elements in front of the sensor to perform multiplexed imaging. There have been several recent papers to reconstruct images from lensless imagers, including methods that utilize deep learning for state-of-the-art performance. However, many of these methods require explicit knowledge of the optical element, such as the point spread function, or learn the reconstruction mapping for a single fixed PSF. In this paper, we explore a neural network architecture that performs joint image reconstruction and PSF estimation to robustly recover images captured with multiple PSFs from different cameras. Using adversarial learning, this approach achieves improved reconstruction results that do not require explicit knowledge of the PSF at test-time and shows an added improvement in the reconstruction model's ability to generalize to variations in the camera's PSF. This allows lensless cameras to be utilized in a wider range of applications that require multiple cameras without the need to explicitly train a separate model for each new camera.",

Previous implementations have proposed an illumination/detection procedure based on a tuned (illumination wavelengths centered at the maximum sensitivity of the camera detection channels) configuration but here we report on a detuned (non-centered ones) scheme resulting in prototype miniaturization and cost reduction. Thus, MISHELF microscopy in combination with a novel and fast iterative algorithm allows high-resolution ($\\mu$m range) phase-retrieved (twin image elimination) quantitative phase imaging of dynamic events (video rate recording speed). The performance of this microscope prototype is validated through experiments using both amplitude (USAF resolution test) and complex (live swine sperm cells and flowing microbeads) samples.

Such minimally invasive imagers allow for navigation into hard-to-reach regions and observation of deep brain activity in freely moving animals. Conventional solutions use distal microlenses. However, as lenses become smaller and less invasive, they develop greater aberrations and restricted fields of view. In addition, most of the imagers capable of variable focusing require mechanical actuation of the lens, increasing the distal complexity and weight. Here, we demonstrate a distal lens-free approach to microendoscopy enabled by computational image recovery. Our approach is entirely actuation free and uses a single pseudorandom spatial mask at the distal end of a multicore fiber. Experimentally, this lensless approach increases the space-bandwidth product, i.e., field of view divided by resolution, by threefold over a best-case lens-based system. In addition, the microendoscope demonstrates color resolved imaging and refocusing to 11 distinct depth planes from a single camera frame without any actuated parts.",

In contrast, we utilize the scattering medium as an unconventional imaging lens and exploit its lens-like properties for lensless three-dimensional (3D) imaging with diffraction-limited resolution. Our spatially incoherent lensless imaging technique is simple and capable of variable focusing with adjustable depths of focus that enables depth sensing of 3D objects that are concealed by the diffusing medium.

In this paper we propose and demonstrate a 'scatter-plate microscope' that utilizes the diffusing property of the random medium for imaging micro structures with diffraction-limited resolution. The ubiquitous property of the speckle patterns permits to exploit the scattering medium as an ultra-thin lensless microscope objective with a variable focal length and a large working distance. The method provides a light, flexible and cost effective imaging device as an alternative to conventional microscope objectives.

Because such imagers have no lens, they are ultra- miniature (\u223c100 $\\mu$m), have large effective depth of field (1 mm to infinity), and are very inexpensive (a few Euro cents). The grating acts as a two-dimensional visual \u201cchirp\u201d and preserves image power throughout the Fourier plane (and hence preserves image information); the final digital image is not captured as in a traditional camera but instead computed from raw photodetector signals. The novel representation at the photodetectors demands that algorithms such as deconvolution, Bayesian estimation, or matrix inversion with Tikhonov regularization be used to compute the image, each having different bandwidth, space and computational complexities for a given image fidelity. Such imaging architectures can also be tailored to extract application-specific information or compute decisions (rather than compute an image) based on the optical signal. In most cases, both the phase grating and the signal processing can be optimized for the information in the visual field and the task at hand. Our sensor design methodology relies on modular parallel and computationally efficient software tools for simulating optical diffraction, for CAD design and layout of gratings themselves, and for sensor signal processing. These sensors are so small they should find use in endoscopy, medical sensing, machine inspection, surveillance and the Internet of Things, and are so inexpensive that they should find use in distributed network applications and in a number of single-use scenarios, for instance in military theaters and hazardous natural and industrial conditions.",

        "abstract": "Camera-based face detection and verification have advanced to the point where they are ready to be integrated into myriad applications, from household appliances to Internet of Things devices to drones. Many of these applications impose stringent constraints on the form-factor, weight, and cost of the camera package that cannot be met by current-generation lens-based imagers. Lensless imaging systems provide an increasingly promising alternative that radically changes the form-factor and reduces the weight and cost of a camera system. However, lensless imagers currently cannot offer the same image resolution and clarity of their lens-based counterparts. This paper details a first-of-its-kind evaluation of the potential and efficacy of lensless imaging systems for face detection and verification. We propose the usage of existing deep learning techniques for face detection and verification that account for the resolution, noise, and artifacts inherent in today's lensless cameras. We demonstrate that both face detection and verification can be performed with high accuracy from the images acquired from lensless cameras, which paves the way to their integration into new applications. A key component of our study is a dataset of 24 112 lensless camera images captured using FlatCam of 88 subjects in a range of different operating conditions.",

        "abstract": "The standard pipeline for many vision tasks uses a conventional camera to capture an image that is then passed to a digital processor for information extraction. In some deployments, such as private locations, the captured digital imagery contains sensitive information exposed to digital vulnerabilities such as spyware, Trojans, etc. However, in many applications, the full imagery is unnecessary for the vision task at hand. In this paper we propose an optical and analog system that preprocesses the light from the scene before it reaches the digital imager to destroy sensitive information. We explore analog and optical encodings consisting of easily implementable operations such as convolution, pooling, and quantization. We perform a case study to evaluate how such encodings can destroy face identity information while preserving enough information for face detection. The encoding parameters are learned via an alternating optimization scheme based on adversarial learning with deep neural networks. We name our system CAnOPIC (Camera with Analog and Optical Privacy-Integrating Computations) and show that it has better performance in terms of both privacy and utility than conventional optical privacy-enhancing methods such as blurring and pixelation.",

        "abstract": "The need for lightweight, miniature imaging systems is becoming increasingly prevalent in light of the development of wearable electronics, IoT devices, and drones. Computational imaging enables new types of imaging systems that replace standard optical components like lenses with cleverly designed computational processes. Traditionally, many of these types of systems use conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) or charge coupled device (CCD) sensors for data collection. While this allows for rapid development of large-scale systems, the lack of system-sensor co-design limits the compactness and performance. Here we propose integrated photonics as a candidate platform for the implementation of such co-integrated systems. Using grating couplers and co-designed computational processing in lieu of a lens, we demonstrate the use of silicon photonics as a viable platform for computational imaging with a prototype lensless imaging device.

        "abstract": "Wavefront sensing is the simultaneous measurement of the amplitude and phase of an incoming optical field. Traditional wavefront sensors such as Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWFS) suffer from a fundamental tradeoff between spatial resolution and phase estimation and consequently can only achieve a resolution of a few thousand pixels. To break this tradeoff, we present a novel computational-imaging-based technique, namely, the Wavefront Imaging Sensor with High resolution (WISH). We replace the microlens array in SHWFS with a spatial light modulator (SLM) and use a computational phase-retrieval algorithm to recover the incident wavefront. This wavefront sensor can measure highly varying optical fields at more than 10-megapixel resolution with the fine phase estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this resolution is an order of magnitude higher than the current noninterferometric wavefront sensors. To demonstrate the capability of WISH, we present three applications, which cover a wide range of spatial scales. First, we produce the diffraction-limited reconstruction for long-distance imaging by combining WISH with a large-aperture, low-quality Fresnel lens. Second, we show the recovery of high-resolution images of objects that are obscured by scattering. Third, we show that WISH can be used as a microscope without an objective lens. Our study suggests that the designing principle of WISH, which combines optical modulators and computational algorithms to sense high-resolution optical fields, enables improved capabilities in many existing applications while revealing entirely new, hitherto unexplored application areas.",

        "abstract": "Lensless imaging eliminates the need for geometric isomorphism between a scene and an image while allowing the construction of compact, lightweight imaging systems. However, a challenging inverse problem remains due to the low reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio. Current implementations require multiple masks or multiple shots to denoise the reconstruction. We propose single-shot lensless imaging with a Fresnel zone aperture and incoherent illumination. By using the Fresnel zone aperture to encode the incoherent rays in wavefront-like form, the captured pattern has the same form as the inline hologram. Since conventional backpropagation reconstruction is troubled by the twin-image problem, we show that the compressive sensing algorithm is effective in removing this twin-image artifact due to the sparsity in natural scenes. The reconstruction with a significantly improved signal-to-noise ratio from a single-shot image promotes a camera architecture that is flat and reliable in its structure and free of the need for strict calibration.",

        "abstract": "Lensless imaging is a technique that records diffraction patterns without using lenses and recovers the complex field of object via phase retrieval. Robust lensless phase retrieval process usually requires multiple measurements with defocus variation, transverse translation or angle-varied illumination. However, making such diverse measurements is time-consuming and limits the application of lensless setup for dynamic samples. In this paper, we propose a single-shot lensless imaging scheme via simultaneous multi-angle LED illumination. Diffraction patterns under multi-angle lights are recorded by different areas of the sensor within a single shot. An optimization algorithm is applied to utilize the single-shot measurement and retrieve the aliasing information for reconstruction. We first use numerical simulations to evaluate the proposed scheme quantitatively by comparisons with the multi-acquisition case. Then a proof-of-concept lensless setup is built to validate the method by imaging a resolution chart and biological samples, achieving &#x0223C; 4.92 &#x003BC;m half-pitch resolution and &#x0223C; 1.202mm2 field of view (FOV).

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel, highly flexible camera. The camera consists of an image detector and a special aperture, but no lens. The aperture is a set of parallel light attenuating layers whose transmittances are controllable in space and time. By applying different transmittance patterns to this aperture, it is possible to modulate the incoming light in useful ways and capture images that are impossible to capture with conventional lens-based cameras. For example, the camera can pan and tilt its field of view without the use of any moving parts. It can also capture disjoint regions of interest in the scene without having to capture the regions in between them. In addition, the camera can be used as a computational sensor, where the detector measures the end result of computations performed by the attenuating layers on the scene radiance values. These and other imaging functionalities can be implemented with the same physical camera and the functionalities can be switched from one video frame to the next via software. We have built a prototype camera based on this approach using a bare image detector and a liquid crystal modulator for the aperture. We discuss in detail the merits and limitations of lensless imaging using controllable apertures. {\\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.",
